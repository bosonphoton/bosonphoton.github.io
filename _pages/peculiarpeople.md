<h4>March 15th, 2024: Lake Tekapo Quacker</h4>

<div style="font-size: 12px;">

<b>Appearance:</b> Could not really tell in the dark but prob 50-60s man or woman<br>

<b>Highlights:</b> <br>

<b>Entry:</b> Stayed in a hostel for a night in Lake Tekapo. In the top bunk next to mine, someone begins snoring incredibly loud. A few minutes later, they start quacking. The quacks are indistinguishable from a duck. The quacks are also precisely and consistently paced. Something more strange happens. 
This person leaves the room in the middle of the night (I assume to use the restroom), but remarkably, the quacking does not stop. They continue quacking on as they head out the door. Only until they get back, the quacking stops. A few hours later, it begins again.


<h4>March 7th, 2024: Stuart and the Pigs</h4>
<div style="font-size: 12px;">
<b>Appearance:</b> 60s, gray messy hair, jeans and plaid farming clothes covered in dust and dirt, barefoot, covered in mud, bright blue eyes, strange friendly demeanor, thick farmer New Zealand accent<br>
<b>Highlights:</b> Has over 150+ pigs as pets<br>
<b>Entry:</b> The most interesting man in Coromandel. I stop on a little dirt road from a few small piglets that stop me in my track. Several feet away, I spot an old man in an enclosed barn fence. As I pet the pigs, he waves his hand to me. He shouts to me, “You can come over here if you’d like”. I make my way over, curious about what he has to say. As I inch closer, I see a shit ton of pigs wandering around inside his fence. I also notice something strange. He has no shoes. His bare feet is standing comfortably pig droppings and mud. He begins conversing about his pigs and tells me he has over 150 of them, pointing to a few and naming their species. I ask him what he plans to do with all these pigs. He proudly states they are just his pets.
He tells me one of his pigs gave birth that morning and asks if I want to pet the newborn piglets. I do not hesitate and follow him through the backyard, across a creek to a broken down shack filled with junk couches, scrap metal, and bunches of old newspapers. He disappears inside. A minute passes. At this moment, I sort of realized I fucked up. I was alone with a strange barefoot man covered in mud in the middle of rural New Zealand behind a creek in a junk house. This is how it ends. He was gonna run out with a damn chainsaw. But soon after he pops back out with 2 baby piglets the size of fists. Relief. He let me name them. My excitement about the piglets seemed to make him happy. He told me how people would pass by, run them over for fun, or steal them. But he said people like me made it worthwhile to keep them out on display. He liked to introduce his prized pigs to fellow animal lovers. He was odd, but there was something pure about him. Something innocent. He did not care for money, fame, glory, or power. Just his pigs. Stuart and the pigs. 


<h4>Feb 28th, 2024: Anon</h4>
<div style="font-size: 12px;">
<b>Appearance:</b> 30s-40s, Skinny, awkward, tired looking, long blonde side parted greasy hair, small framed dusty glasses, dressed in shaggy all- black clothing<br>
<b>Highlights:</b> Contrarian conspiracy beliefs, former scientologist & free mason, conspiracy about Covid and New World Order (NWO), apparently chatted with Bill Gates<br>
<b>Entry:</b> He enters the kitchen with a plate of pressed down rice and
a thin worn down plastic baggy of a husk of corn, tomatoes, and orange peels. I cannot 
tell if it is compost or food. While he opens a can of tuna and spoons 
it onto his pressed down plate of rice, he starts to mention his pasts interests with Scientology. He states how science and intelligence 
is associated with Cain (the “yin” child of Adam and Eve). He also mentions he was a free mason for a very short period of time then left. 
In our 4 hour conversation, he also has many interesting things to say about 
time travel, 5th dimensions, true unity of Consciousness, Baha’i faith, etc. He has very contrarian beliefs and conspiracy theories, but I remain respectful and listen promptly. We get to the 
topic of Covid and he believes the entire point is vaccines is some sort of digital identification / transformation (what he calls the singularity) that 
will allow “them” to control and reduce the population. To essentially wipe out the weak. It’s 
part of something called the “New World Order". The general idea is that the "elites" will impose “chaos” upon the general population, 
so that they can then reintroduce “order”. I am surprised by the clarity and succinct flow of his thoughts. I press him with questions that challenge his beliefs, but he addresses them quite well, with a sufficient amount of self-awareness. Clearly his beliefs are kooky but what I found really interesting was how he was able to come up with reasonably sound arguments 
for such extreme beliefs. I like him though. He still sends me some conspiracy articles to this day.
