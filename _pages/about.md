Hi there. I'm an incoming MS SymSys student at Stanford and a recent grad from Binghamton University with double degrees in Quantitative Neuroscience and Business MIS, advised by <a href = "https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/people/profile.html?id=kkurtz">Kenneth J. Kurtz</a> (cognitive ML), <a href = "https://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~szhang/">Shiqi Zhang</a> (robotics), and <a href = "https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/people/profile.html?id=slynn">Steven Jay Lynn</a> (psych). I was also a summer neuro research fellow at Caltech advised by <a href = "https://neuroscience.caltech.edu/people/shinsuke-shin-shimojo">Shinsuke Shimojo</a>, and a statistics intern at NASA advised by <a href = "https://science.nasa.gov/people/dr-arik-posner/">Arik Posner</a> and <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/esayas-shume-0ba15020//">Esayas Shume</a>.

My primary interests lie at the intersection of neuroscience, mathematics, and ML. I believe that by exploring the symbolic underpinnings of human cognition, we can build machines representative of a general, explainable, and interpretable intelligence that can advance scientific pursuits and improve upon the human condition. My CV [here](assets/ZouCV.pdf). Interesting and interested people, please reach me by <a href="mailto:chelseazoubz@gmail.com">email</a>.
