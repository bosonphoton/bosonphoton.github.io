Hi there. I'm an MS SymSys student at Stanford. I did my undergrad at Binghamton University with double degrees in quantitative neuroscience (math + neuro) and business MIS, advised by <a href = "https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/people/profile.html?id=kkurtz">Kenneth J. Kurtz</a>, <a href = "https://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~szhang/">Shiqi Zhang</a>, and <a href = "https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/people/profile.html?id=slynn">Steven Jay Lynn</a>. I was also a summer neuro research fellow at Caltech advised by <a href = "https://neuroscience.caltech.edu/people/shinsuke-shin-shimojo">Shinsuke Shimojo</a>, and a statistics intern at NASA advised by <a href = "https://science.nasa.gov/people/dr-arik-posner/">Arik Posner</a> and <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/esayas-shume-0ba15020//">Esayas Shume</a>.

Interested in neuroscience, mathematics, machine learning, and startups (deep tech). I believe that by exploring the symbolic underpinnings of human cognition, we can build algorithms representative of a general, explainable, and interpretable intelligence that can advance scientific pursuits and improve upon the human condition. My CV [here](assets/ZouCV.pdf). Interesting and interested people, please reach me by <a href="mailto:chelseazoubz@gmail.com">email</a>.
