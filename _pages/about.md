Hi there. Welcome! My primary interests lie at the intersection of neuroscience, mathematics, and AI. I believe that by exploring the logical/statistical underpinnings of human cognition, we can build machines representative of a general, explainable, and interpretable intelligence that can advance scientific pursuits and improve upon the human condition. My CV [here](assets/ZouCV.pdf). Interesting and interested people, please reach me by <a href="mailto:chelseazoubz@gmail.com">email</a>.
