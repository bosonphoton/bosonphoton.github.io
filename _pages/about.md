Hi there. I'm an MS Symbolic Systems student at Stanford. In undergrad, I studied applied math and neuroscience at Binghamton University advised by <a href = "https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/people/profile.html?id=kkurtz">Kenneth J. Kurtz</a> (ML), <a href = "https://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~szhang/">Shiqi Zhang</a> (robotics), and <a href = "https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/people/profile.html?id=slynn">Steven Jay Lynn</a> (psych). I also did some neuroscience research at Caltech advised by <a href = "https://neuroscience.caltech.edu/people/shinsuke-shin-shimojo">Shinsuke Shimojo</a>, and statistics stuff at NASA advised by <a href = "https://science.nasa.gov/people/dr-arik-posner/">Arik Posner</a> and <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/esayas-shume-0ba15020//">Esayas Shume</a>.

Currently in <a href = "https://cocolab.stanford.edu/">CoCo Lab</a> part of <a href = "https://ai.stanford.edu/">Stanford AI Lab</a> developing self-improving AI for planning and reasoning tasks.
My only goal is to advance science and humanity. If you got any ideas, <a href="mailto:chelseazoubz@gmail.com">ping me</a>.
