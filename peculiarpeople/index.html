He starts by comparing social media addictions to the drug Soma from Huxley's Brave New World, and spirals into a discussion surrounding the chaos of society, politics, government, and people. In this conversation, he compares the human herd mentality to topics in Orwell's 1984, as well as Alexander's rat park study. The rant continues on as he states how easily people are manipulated, brainwashed, and controlled, and believes this is why the world is descending into corruption. "Humanity ends because there are too many stupid people", he laughs. He also tells me to search him up on Google. There are several articles on him, and I find out he ran for local government. <h4>March 21st, 2024: Rose</h4> <div style="font-size: 12px;"> <b>Appearance:</b> Mid 20s, short dyed hair, circle framed glasses, williamsburg lgbtq hippie vibes<br> <b>Entry:</b> I met Rose from a meditation volunteer retreat in Australia. They voice their perspectives on technology and society, and shares a powerful ayahuasca experience they had in Columbia. They believe technology is advancing too quick and much of it is unnecessary to humanity. I tell them it justifies better living conditions. They agree but responds there may be a tradeoff between the physical anguish of pre-modern societies (hunting for food, dealing with cold winters, etc.) and mental anguish experienced in modern ones (mental health, depression, suicide, etc.). True. We get to the topic of psychedelics, and they share their experience of meeting these celestial beings on DMT. I ask them if they suppose the DMT entities objectively exist or are just figments of their subjective consciousness. Their impression is that the entities exist objectively, but what they saw were just "projections" of the higher dimensional beings onto our reality, compressed in a way our brains can comprehend. <h4>March 15th, 2024: Lake Tekapo Quacker</h4> <div style="font-size: 12px;"> <b>Appearance:</b> Could not really tell in the dark but prob 50-60s man or woman<br> <b>Entry:</b> Stayed in a hostel for a night in Lake Tekapo. In the top bunk next to mine, someone begins snoring incredibly loud. A few minutes later, the snores turn into quacks? Consistently paced duck quacks. Something more strange happens. This person leaves the room in the middle of the night (I assume to use the restroom), but remarkably, the quacking does not stop. They continue quacking on as they head out the door. Once they return to the room, the quacking stops. A few hours later, it begins again. <h4>March 7th, 2024: Stuart and the Pigs</h4> <div style="font-size: 12px;"> <b>Appearance:</b> 60s, gray messy hair, jeans and plaid farming clothes covered in dust and dirt, barefoot, covered in mud, bright blue eyes, strange friendly demeanor, thick farmer New Zealand accent<br> <b>Highlights:</b> Has over 150+ pigs as pets<br> <b>Entry:</b> The most interesting man in Coromandel. I stop on a little dirt road from a few small piglets that stop me in my track. Several feet away, I spot an old man in an enclosed barn fence. As I pet the pigs, he waves his hand to me. He shouts to me, “You can come over here if you’d like”. I make my way over, curious about what he has to say. As I inch closer, I see a shit ton of pigs wandering around inside his fence. I also notice something strange. He has no shoes. His bare feet is standing comfortably pig droppings and mud. He begins conversing about his pigs and tells me he has over 150 of them, pointing to a few and naming their species. I ask him what he plans to do with all these pigs. He proudly states they are just his pets. He tells me one of his pigs gave birth that morning and asks if I want to pet the newborn piglets. I do not hesitate and follow him through the backyard, across a creek to a broken down shack filled with junk couches, scrap metal, and bunches of old newspapers. He disappears inside. A minute passes. At this moment, I sort of realized I fucked up. I was alone with a strange barefoot man covered in mud in the middle of rural New Zealand behind a creek in a junk house. This is how it ends. He was gonna run out with a damn chainsaw. But soon after he pops back out with 2 baby piglets the size of fists. Relief. He let me name them. My excitement about the piglets seemed to make him happy. He told me how people would pass by, run them over for fun, or steal them. But he said people like me made it worthwhile to keep them out on display. He liked to introduce his prized pigs to fellow animal lovers. He was odd, but there was something pure about him. Something innocent. He did not care for money, fame, glory, or power. Just his pigs.
