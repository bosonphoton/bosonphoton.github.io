I cannot tell if it is compost or food. We strike up a convo while he opens a can of tuna and spoons it onto his pressed down plate of rice. The conversation begins with me talking a bit about science and technology. Somehow this branches off into him mentioning his pasts interests with Scientology and how science and intelligence is associated with Cain (the “yin” child of Adam and Eve). He also mentions he was a free mason for a very short period of time then left. Then in our 4 hour conversation, he also has interesting things to say about time travel, 5th dimensions, true unity of Consciousness, Baha’i faith, etc. He has very contrarian beliefs (conspiracy theories), but I remain respectful and listen promptly. Anyways we get to the topic of Covid and he believes the entire point is vaccines is a sort of digital identification / transformation (what he calls the singularity) that will allow “them” to control us and reduce overpopulation, and essentially wipe of the weak. It’s part of something called the “New World Order” where the entire point is the "elites" will impose “chaos” upon the general population, so that they can then reintroduce “order”. The surprising thing is that even with all this, he actually seems pretty self aware. I can tell he was actually a smart dude by the way he responds to my questions. I mean, clearly his beliefs are kooky but what's really interesting is how he is able to come up with reasonably sound arguments for such extreme beliefs. I ask him what started his belief system, and I think he has gone through a lot of hard times in the past. His mum died when he was young, he has some chronic injury that he needs medical treatment for, and has overall been tested a lot in life. I think maybe that’s why he believes in the things he does. I was scouting for some past trauma to make sense as to how someone begins with these contrarian beliefs. I like him though. He still sends me some conspiracy articles to this day. <h4>March 7th, 2024: Stuart and the Pigs</h4> <div style="font-size: 12px;"> <b>Appearance:</b> 60s, gray messy hair, jeans and plaid farming clothes covered in dust and dirt, barefoot, covered in mud, bright blue eyes, strange friendly deamenor, thick farmer NZ/AUS accent<br> <b>Highlights:</b> Has over 150+ pigs purely as his pets<br> <b>Entry:</b> The most interesting man in Coromandel. I stop on a little dirt road because a few small piglets stop me in my track. I’m thrilled. I get out of my car and several feet away I spot an old man in an enclosed barn fence. He sees me start to pet the baby pigs and waves his hand to me. “You can come over here if you’d like” he shouts to me. I make my way over, curious about what he has to say, and as I inch closer, I realize I see a shit ton — and I mean a SHIT TON of pigs of all sizes just chilling inside his fence. And he is just barefoot, walking around in their droppings. Immediately, he begins conversing all about his pigs (there was currently over 150), pointing to a few and talking about their species. “So what do you do with all these pigs? Sell them? Eat them?”, I ask. He proudly states they are just his pets. He then tells me that one of his pigs just gave birth and asks if I want to pet the babies — I did not hesitate and followed him through the backyard across a creek to a broken down shack filled with junk couches, scrap metal, and bunches of newpapers. He disappeared inside. A minute passed. At this moment, I sort of realized I fucked up. I was alone with a strange looking barefoot man covered in mud in the middle of rural New Zealand behind a creek to a junk house. This is how it ends. He was gonna run out with a damn chainsaw. But soon after he popped back out with 2 baby piglets the size of fists in his hands. Relief. He let me name them — Gravity and Obsidian (idk don’t ask). I think him seeing me so excited about the piglets made him really happy. He told me stories about how people would pass by, and run them over for fun, or steal them, but he said it was people like me that made it worthwhile to keep them out. He wanted to introduce his prized pigs to fellow animal lovers. He was odd, but there was something so pure and innocent about him. He didn’t care for money, fame, glory, or power. Just his pigs.
