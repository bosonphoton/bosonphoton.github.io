<h1>Academia Deromanticized</h1>
I am writing this entry now that I decided fairly recently to not pursue my dreams of a PhD. It is in part a self reflection to figure out why, and what I really want for my career (and in part to minimize any potential regret of turning down a fully funded CMU PhD offer for an overpriced MS degree).
<br><br>
Up until a few months ago, I thought I was certain of my career trajectory. As I romanticized the role of becoming a research scientist at DeepMind, the pressure to go through the obvious route of a PhD intensified. During my undergrad, I went ham. Research became my life and took up 90% of my mind. I was in three research labs simultaneously and took on two external research internships in the span of three years. All five were in different fields: ML, robotics, neuroscience, psychology, and statistics. The interdisciplinarity of my weeks were exhilarating.
<br><br>
I should mention it was incredibly interesting to observe the differences in traits and the way people thought about things within different departments. For instance, in the robotics lab, which was part of the CS/engineering school, the researchers were more logical and sharp, but tended to be less abstract. The cognitive science researchers in the psych department were more creative and inventive, but less rigorous in their thought processes. But both groups had a common denominator: an intense commitment to their respective fields.
<br><br>
After being surrounded by these people, I decided that I would probably be a mediocre research scientist. To be successful in academia, I think one needs to be more vertically minded in the sense where one can dedicate their cognitive resources into a narrow but deep slot. I, on the other hand, was inherently a dabbler (in case you couldn't tell by my majors and interests). I also got to see the dark side of academia. Toxic advisors, publish-or-perish pressures, nocturnal working hours, shitty reviewers, and depressed PhDs.
<br><br>
What I personally do not enjoy about research is spending too much time on niche problems that (unfortunately in hindsight), I realize in the end are neither productive to the bigger picture nor interesting to my original curiosities. Results of research are oftentimes disentangled from the real world, solving simulated toy problems in labs constrained by a precise set of controlled parameters. And only a small percentage of groundbreaking works truly make an impact. More often than not, people go in asking interesting questions and end up being squeezed into working on slightly less interesting problems. The dude who wants to figure out how the brain works ends up spending 6 years of his life studying the impact of UV rays on retinal ganglion cell mechanics. Same with the gal who wants to understand the nature of matter ends up focusing on the geometric properties of pressurized gallium arsenide. The topic of your work becomes so niche that there are maybe 5-10 other people that can truly understand what you do (this may or may not include your own PI lol).
<br><br>
I mean, I guess this is expected because obviously science is hard. The unknown is so vast that researchers must hone in on a microcosm of their field, otherwise they end up accomplishing – or rather <i>publishing</i>, nothing. For one, <b>research is an incredibly slow and lengthy process</b> that requires much patience and grit.
<br><br>
Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely still have love for research. I love the struggle of learning something difficult. I love the feeling of finally understanding something difficult. I love grueling through dense, boring papers only to appreciate the beauty of it after the 10th read. I love being able to mentally simplify an abstract topic that can, after some time, jibe with my intuition. I love the rush that comes with a new idea. I love critically thinking through some reasons why my initial idea failed. I love the brainstorming sessions, the whiteboard discussions, the random wake-up-in-the-middle-of-the-night-to-jot-down-a-bad-idea moments, and finally, I absolutely love the jargony, technical discussions with a peer, that to an outsider, sounds like a whole new language of nerd gibberish. But as corny as it sounds, what I love most is the people. These are some of the smartest, most curious, and determined people you can find on campus.
<br><br>
So here was the dilemma. Research felt too slow and unproductive to real world problems for me. Yet, I loved the people, culture, and environment. I had to figure out how I could integrate the stuff I liked while marginalizing out the variables I didn’t like. That left me with the option of doing an MS degree, or working at a startup. I decided to first pursue the former, which would probably eventually help me with the latter anyways. I would still be able to learn new things, work on difficult problems, brainstorm and discuss ideas, befriend academics, and reap all the promises of research, but without the perils of rabbit-holing, publishing stress, and a 6 year commitment. Of course there’s that part where I go into student debt, but for now I’m choosing to remain fairly confident (naive) that I’ll be able to pay it off soon after.
