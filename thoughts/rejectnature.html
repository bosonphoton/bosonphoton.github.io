<h1>I Don't Believe in Nature</h1>
<i>Reject the biological default.</i>
<br><br>

I recently thought about and got annoyed at evolution for creating women the way it did. Not only did nature decide for us to suffer from the pain of childbirth, but also bear the mental and physical burden from 9 months of pregnancy, where some women may never even recover from the after-effects and permanent hormonal disruptions of post-delivery (see <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_depression">postpartum depression</a>). Should the process of extending an existence of a species be so uncomfortable and potentially even <a href = "https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/maternal-mortality">dangerous</a> to the species itself? Moreover, why only one of the sexes?

<br><br>
Many behaviors deemed evolutionarily beneficial to us involve some form of pleasure, so one would think that evolution should keep childbirth as pleasurable as possible. This should in theory encourage reproduction and reinforce the process to carry out our species. But no, nature decided to make it fucking painful. Then, I thought about it some more. Childbearing initiates from a two step recipe: sex and fertilization. Sex serves as a motivator for reproduction, which makes sense as it activates pleasure pathways for both parties involved. But once fertilization is achieved, only one of the two parties gets screwed over and begins a laborious, painful, and potentially dangerous process to grow new life. So basically, sex is a scam for women to engage in an act until the second phase of fertilization is accomplished.

<br><br>
It’s all fun and games until some parasite-like fetus begins to suck all available nutrients and energy from its host, while placing them at risk to horrible things like gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and pregnancy nose. And even after all of this, like a classic case of Stockholm Syndrome, many women will relive it all for more children. Why? Because again, I claim it's nature's perfectly crafted scam. After childbirth, the mother’s body releases a surge of oxytocin and other hormones that gets them all drugged up into thinking that it was all… worth it? I mean maybe. But we never asked to take one for the team, so the least nature could have done for us is to not make childbirth so damn painful (btw I’m also semi-kidding so don’t take anything I say above too seriously).

<br><br>
To be fair, some studies have shown that women who went through full-term pregnancies had <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/hormones/reproductive-history-fact-sheet">lower chances</a> of developing certain ovarian and endometrial cancers. But then there are also studies that reveal pregnancy can increase risks of <a href="https://unclineberger.org/news/study-finds-higher-risk-of-breast-cancer-for-women-after-childbirth/">breast cancer</a> for years after delivery. This isn’t too surprising though, since there are many more examples of biological dilemmas and tradeoffs that go far beyond reproduction. Basically, it's really fucking complicated.

<br><br>
Anyways, to try to make sense of it, I had to look at things under a different light. I realized I can't be angry and blame nature for the way things are, because there is nothing and no one to blame. Evolution doesn’t care about our feelings or what's fair or what’s “the best”. It’s about what works, up until it doesn’t. It is simply a stochastic process driven by physical laws governing chemistry and biology, so me complaining about these things is like me complaining that e = mc^2.

<br><br>
Perhaps even thinking about evolution in terms of whether an event or trait is “beneficial” can be misleading. A better way to think about things might be: “It’s the logical outcome that arises when nature takes the path of least resistance, given the organism’s genetic makeup and its surrounding environmental pressures”. There is no intrinsic directionality to evolution, so thinking there’s some higher level goal (such as procreation) could very well be wrong. Things are the way they are because, by random permutation, they just so happen to end up in a state that works. Nature’s slogan should probably just be “shit happens”, and if things work, it sticks around.

<br><br>
Sometimes along the way, very cool things occur. However, this also means that some not-so-cool things occur. This is more of a tangent, but we suffer and die. Death is probably fine, but suffering is not (one can philosophically argue that suffering is necessary in order for happiness to exist but imho I believe that’s bullshit and just a way for humans to try and justify the unfair world we live in. People suffer at different levels, and some people can live a great life without much suffering).

<br><br>
With that being said, I do not believe in letting nature carry out its natural course. If we did not actively intervene, life expectancy would hover at around <a href = "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5719695/">33 years</a> of age, many women would be <a href ="https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality">dying</a> from natural childbirth, life-saving surgical procedures would not exist, and many viral infectious diseases like measles would easily wipe us out. So I <i>absolutely</i> think that we should, in fact, change the default trajectory of evolution and alter our biology to improve it. If we have the technological potential to improve nature’s random outcomes, we shall make it our priority to do so.
